# MTVRPTW

This repository contains the implementation of the solution algorithm for Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Window (MTVRPTW).

This is my B.Comp. Dissertation. The report can be found in Report.pdf.

What I have done in this project:

-   Researched and experimented with existing algorithms for related
    problems in the literature.

-   Proposed new algorithms to solve the Muti-Trip Vehicle Routing
    Problem with Time Window.

-   Designed a meta-heuristic that outperforms existing benchmarks.

-   Analyzed different design choices for the proposed meta-heuristic.

-   Evaluated the performance of the meta-heuristic w.r.t different
    parameters.


Important classes:

- MTVRPTW.java : Set running configuration, read input, print output
